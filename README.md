This one is a rent-a-car model card from Front-End Mentor.
The challenge was to build a simple page with a centered div that had three parts. As it is a small and symmetrical project and all the elements within each of the three divisions were left aligned I was able to repeat the classNames or not use it at all

I've just make it responsive and got rid of some useless div's that made it easy to build the page but then i realize they  wasn't needed.
